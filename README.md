# Tokenizer Visualizer

Tokenizer playground to see how different Hugging Face tokenizers split your prompt.

## Features
- Model dropdown with popular tokenizers (GPT-2/Neo/OPT, LLaMA test tokenizer, Mistral, BERT, RoBERTa, T5, etc.).
- Color-coded token stream with IDs and special-token highlighting.
- Clipboard copy for the token list.
- Optional Hugging Face access token for gated models (kept in-memory only).



## Hugging Face token (optional)
- Public tokenizers (e.g., `gpt2`, `bert-base-uncased`) work without a token.
- Gated models (e.g., real LLaMA) need an HF access token—paste it in the field and requests will include it. The token stays in memory only.
